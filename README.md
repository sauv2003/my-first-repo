No, for even \( n \), the number of distinct solutions to the \( N \)-queens problem is **not always equal to \( n/2 \)**. The number of solutions depends on the specific value of \( n \), and there is no simple formula like \( n/2 \) for determining the count of distinct solutions.

### Key Points About \( N \)-Queens Solutions:
1. **Distinct Solutions**:
   - The number of solutions varies significantly with \( n \) and does not follow a linear or simple pattern.
   - For example:
     - \( n = 4 \): 2 distinct solutions.
     - \( n = 6 \): 4 distinct solutions.
     - \( n = 8 \): 92 distinct solutions.

2. **Symmetry Reductions**:
   - Symmetries such as rotations and reflections can reduce the count of distinct solutions from the total number of configurations.

3. **Even \( n \)**:
   - While some specific even values of \( n \) may coincidentally have solutions proportional to \( n/2 \), this is not a general rule.

4. **Counting Solutions**:
   - Computing the number of solutions is generally a combinatorial and computational problem. Efficient algorithms and backtracking techniques are typically used.

If you'd like, I can help explain the \( N \)-queens problem in detail, or we can explore some small cases to see how the solutions are counted.
